## FAQ

**Q: Can I test my bot without having to wait for its scheduled time?**

A: Yes! Update the `test.js` file, and then use the [Glitch terminal](https://help.glitch.com/hc/en-us/articles/16287551842829-Project-Terminal) to run `node test.js`.

**Q: How can I update the showcase page?**

A: The showcase page uses [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. You can find all the template files inside the `views` folder. 

**Q: Can I make bots that use Puppeteer?**

A: [Not anymore](https://help.glitch.com/hc/en-us/articles/24390278437773-Why-can-t-I-get-Puppeteer-to-work-on-Glitch-anymore), sorry!
